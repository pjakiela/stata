# Data Visualization in Stata: Tips

1. Use `set scheme s1mono` so that your graphs have a white background (instead of Stata's defauly light blue).

2. Use color intentionally.  Claus Wilke has a great discussion of color [here](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-basics.html) 
(in [_Fundamentals of Data Visualization_](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html)).  The `blindschemes` package in Stata 
will allow you to access the colors of the Okabe-Ito color-blind safe colorscale.
