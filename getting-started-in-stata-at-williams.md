# Getting Started in Stata

Williams students can download Stata from [Williams OIT](https://oit.williams.edu/software/).  Search 
for Stata on the OIT webpage, and then click on the Stata SE option.  From there, scroll down 
to select the Mac or Windows option as appropriate.  You'll be taken to a google doc where you can 
download the Stata installer.  After you install Stata, you'll need to enter the serial number, 
code, and authorization listed in the google doc the first time you open Stata.
